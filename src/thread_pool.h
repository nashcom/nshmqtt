// Fixed-size worker pool for the HTTP listener: the accept loop hands off
// each accepted connection fd to the pool, which queues it for whichever
// worker thread picks it up next. Chosen over thread-per-connection or an
// epoll event loop because each connection is a short-lived request/response
// exchange -- a small bounded pool gives predictable resource use without
// the complexity of an async reactor. This is unrelated to mqtt.h's own
// single dedicated MQTT worker thread (see its own comment for why that one
// is deliberately not a pool).
